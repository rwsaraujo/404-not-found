# DevChallenges - 404 Not Found

404 Not Found is a page that informs the user of the 404 ERROR (response to the request not found on the server). There is a message giving details of what happened to the user and a button to return them to the home page (not functional for the purpose of this project).

This project was developed as a challenge proposed by the devChallenges website as a way of consolidating knowledge in building responsive pages (beginner level).
